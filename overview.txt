Project Plan: Telco Customer Churn Prediction

Objective: Develop a robust machine learning model to predict customer 
churn in a telco dataset. The project will focus on automated EDA, 
insightful data presentation, feature engineering, and the application of 
multiple ML algorithms to identify the best performing model.

Deliverables:
Exploratory Data Analysis Presentation
Machine Learning Presentation
Model with specs

Project Phases:

Data Preparation and Initial Setup

Load Data: Import the Telco Churn dataset into the environment.
Automated EDA: Implement an automated EDA library like pandas-profiling or 
Sweetviz to generate an initial report.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, correct data types, and address 
outliers as identified by the EDA.
Data Presentation

Data Summary Presentation:
Create a presentation summarizing key data insights.
Highlight Noteworthy Findings: For example, if certain features like 
contract type or monthly charges have a strong correlation with churn, 
explicitly mention these in the presentation.
Questionable Data Points: Identify any unusual patterns or outliers (e.g., 
negative values in monthly charges) and provide hypotheses or suggest 
further investigation.
Hypotheses and Model Strategies

Hypotheses:

Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn than 
those with longer-term contracts.
Higher monthly charges are associated with higher churn rates, possibly 
due to perceived value for money.
Customers with a history of technical issues or poor customer service 
interactions are more likely to churn.
Machine Learning Strategies:

Feature Engineering:

Create features like Tenure_Buckets, Total_Charges_Per_Tenure, and 
Contract_Types_Encoded.
Perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables such as Payment Method, 
Contract, and Internet Service.
Engineer interaction terms like MonthlyCharges*Contract_Type to capture 
non-linear relationships.
Algorithm Selection:

Baseline Models: Start with Logistic Regression and Decision Trees for 
baseline performance.
Advanced Models: Use Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines 
(XGBoost/LightGBM), and Support Vector Machines.
Deep Learning: Apply a simple Neural Network if data distribution supports 
it.
Model Training and Evaluation

Model Training: Use stratified cross-validation to ensure balanced class 
distribution across training and test splits.
Evaluation Metrics: Focus on precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC due 
to the class imbalance issue.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV or Bayesian Optimization to 
fine-tune model parameters for best performance.
Model Interpretation and Feature Importance

SHAP Values & LIME: Use SHAP and LIME to interpret model predictions and 
understand feature importance.
Feature Importance Presentation: Highlight key features influencing churn 
predictions.
Deployment and Monitoring

Deployment Plan: Deploy the best-performing model as a REST API using 
Flask or FastAPI.
Monitoring: Implement logging and monitoring for model performance in 
real-world use cases, focusing on accuracy and drift detection.
Additional Suggestions

Class Imbalance Handling: If churn rate is low, implement techniques like 
SMOTE or undersampling.
Automated Reporting: Set up automated reports to generate insights from 
predictions and feedback loops for model retraining.
Feedback Loop: Create a mechanism for gathering feedback on model 
predictions to refine features and improve model accuracy.
Deliverables:

Automated EDA Report
Data Presentation Deck
Model Training Notebook with Evaluations
Model Deployment API
Final Report on Model Performance and Interpretations
